# Fair_HIN
  * Source code for ICWSM 2021 paper [**Fair Representation Learning for Heterogeneous Information Networks**](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08769)


## Usage
  * For balance-data, M2V, M2V + fair-sampling, M2V + projection, M2V + fair-sampling + projection, go to ```meta_path```
  * For adversarial, GNN-demographic-parity, GNN-equal-opportunity, go to ```GNNs```
